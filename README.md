# RISE

Everything related to the Penn State Rocket Lab Initiative **(mostly python)**.

I am currently working on writing a program and designing a model rocket on which I will launch a Raspberry Pi with an array of sensors.

Very much still *in progress*.


# ToDo

- find appropriate camera resolution and framerate, [here's a helpful article](https://picamera.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.10/fov.html)
  - the spycam is the same as the picamera v1
- make script start on startup
- stop collecting data on landing, when the pressure data is no longer changing
